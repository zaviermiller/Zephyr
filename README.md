# Zephyr
Zephyr is a reactive frontend Go framework that borrows some principles from [VueJS](https://www.vuejs.org). Our goal is to bring WebAssembly to the forefront of the frontend industry by providing an intuitive API for an already simple language

This API is very much unfinished/experimental and will evolve over time, not only as we learn what users need but also as Go improves as well. For example, the APIs will be even more intuitive with the introduction of Generics in Go1.18, making it easier to get up and running with just the runtime. But for now, don't put in prod.

## Design Philosophies
 - **Beginner-friendly** - Easy for people coming over from JS and beginners alike
 - **Write clean Go** - The Zephyr templating language is meant to be written in a way that mimics how Go code is written. There are a few abstractions to make frontend development easier, but for the most part, just write Go as you normally would. The entire templating language and build process is optional, if you prefer to build UIs with Go, go for it!
